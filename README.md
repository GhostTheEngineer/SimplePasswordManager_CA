## 🛠 Features
- Save passwords for different websites.
- View stored passwords.
- Simple menu-driven interface.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To compile and run this program, you need a C++ compiler. You can use:
- **GCC** (g++)
- **Clang**
- **MSVC (Microsoft Visual C++)**

### 🔧 Compilation Instructions
Run the following command in your terminal to compile the program:

```sh
g++ -o password_manager ./main.cpp
```

To execute the program:

```sh
./password_manager
```

### 📂 How It Works
1. Run the program.
2. Choose an option from the menu:
   - **1:** Add a new password (Site name + Password).
   - **2:** View all saved passwords.
   - **3:** Exit the program.
3. Passwords are stored in a file named `passwords.txt` in the same directory.

## ❗ Notes
- This is a basic version of a password manager. It **does not** use encryption, so do not use it to store real passwords.
- If `passwords.txt` does not exist, it will be created automatically.
- The program will append new passwords to the file.
